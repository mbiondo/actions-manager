## Actions Proposal

This library is designed to manage user actions on entities based on context, leveraging the power of TypeScript generics. It provides a flexible and type-safe way to define and control what actions a user can perform on specific entities within different contexts. By using generics, the library ensures that the actions and contexts are strongly typed, reducing runtime errors and improving the developer experience. Whether you need to manage permissions, workflows, or dynamic behavior, this library offers a robust solution tailored to your TypeScript applications.
